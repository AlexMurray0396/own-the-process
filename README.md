# Purpose

This year I ran over 2000km, I completed 3 (so far) modules from my master's degree programme, started 2 new jobs, and started learning about backend development.

All this is good, but I felt disorganised, wasteful of my time and lacking in intentionality.

In 2026, I want to address this feeling. I want to log my activities to understand where my time goes and use that to give myself a stronger sense of purpose in the year to come.
